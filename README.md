# Idle Blocker
This is a simple Windows Forms tray application that prevents Windows from
entering into an idle state. Specifically, this is meant to prevent scheduled
tasks with "On idle" triggers from executing, such as those related to automatic
maintenance (which can't be disabled in Windows 10). Useful for when you just
want to charge your laptop but Windows decides to drain all your battery in
Idle Maintenance the moment you step away.
